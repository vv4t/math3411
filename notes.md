## Bayes Theorem

P(A|B) = P(B|A) x P(A) / P(B)

# Compression Coding

## Huffman-Knuth

Average code length is sum of probabilities at child nodes.
That is, sum of probablities of the merged symbols.

# Information Theory

## Entropy of Extensions

H(S) <= L^n / n <= H(S) + 1

as n -> Infinity, L^n / n -> H(S)

## Joint Entroy

I(A,B) = H(A) + H(B) - H(A,B)
